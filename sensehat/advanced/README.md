# Something more than basics for Sense HAT

bounce
------
simple example of 3 pixels moving around the LED matrix and reflecting from the edges.


falling_dots
-------------
randomly generated dots falling from the top to the bottom of the LED matrix (like rain).
This is the simple scene for my game, where the other, moving pixel must try to avoid the collision
with this falling dots.


collisions
-----------
combined the two above into one project: bouncing pixel moves around the screen and reflects
from the screen edges and from the falling dots.

simple_game
------------
really simple game, not even the game, just first try :).
Moved (using gyroscope) pixel, trying to avoid falling dots.
